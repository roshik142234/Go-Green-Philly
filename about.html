          The production of plastic has increased dramatically over the past few
          decades due to its versatility, durability, and low cost of
          production. However, plastic is also a major contributor to
          environmental pollution, particularly in oceans. Plastic is not
          biodegradable and can persist in the environment for hundreds of
          years. When plastic waste is not properly disposed of or managed, it
          can end up in rivers and oceans. The plastic waste can be carried by
          the currents and accumulate in large masses, known as "garbage
          patches." Marine animals can mistake plastic for food or become
          entangled in it, leading to injury and death. As these animals are an
          important part of the marine food chain, the plastic pollution can
          also have ripple effects on entire ecosystems. The increase in plastic
          production and the amount of plastic found in oceans are
          interconnected issues. As more plastic is produced, there is a greater
          likelihood that it will end up in the oceans if proper waste
          management practices are not in place.

      <!--Information on how plastic is made-->
      <div id="how-plastic" class="container">
        <h2>How Is Plastic Made?</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic is made from organic polymers, which are created through a
          process called polymerization. This process involves combining smaller
          molecules called monomers, typically through a chemical reaction, to
          form larger molecules called polymers. There are a wide variety of
          polymers used in the production of plastic, including polyethylene,
          polypropylene, polystyrene, and PVC. Once the polymerization process
          is complete, other materials are added to the polymer in a process
          called compounding. These materials can include pigments to add color,
          stabilizers to protect against UV radiation, and plasticizers to
          improve flexibility and workability. The specific additives used
          depend on the desired properties of the final product. The polymer is
          then processed and shaped into the desired form, which can include
          extrusion, injection molding, blow molding, and other techniques. In
          extrusion, the polymer is melted and forced through a die to create a
          continuous shape, such as a pipe or sheet. Injection molding involves
          melting the polymer and injecting it into a mold to create a specific
          shape, such as a bottle cap or toy. Blow molding uses air pressure to
          shape the polymer into a hollow object, such as a plastic bottle.
          Overall, the production of plastic involves a complex series of
          processes that vary depending on the specific type of plastic being
          made and the desired properties of the final product.

      <!--Information on how recycling works-->
      <div id="howitworks" class="container">
        <h2>How Does Recycling Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Recycling is an important process that helps to reduce the amount of
          waste that goes into landfills and conserve natural resources. The
          process of recycling starts with the collection of waste materials,
          which can be done through curbside pick-up, drop-off centers, or
          recycling bins located in public places. Once the waste materials have
          been collected, they are sorted by type. This is typically done by
          hand or using specialized machinery, such as conveyor belts, magnets,
          and optical scanners. The sorted materials are then cleaned and
          processed to remove any contaminants, such as food residue or labels.
          After cleaning and processing, the materials are transformed into new
          products through a variety of techniques, such as melting, shredding,
          and molding. For example, plastic bottles can be melted down and
          turned into new plastic products, such as furniture or toys. Paper can
          be shredded and pulped to make new paper products, such as newspapers
          or cardboard boxes. The final step in the recycling process is the
          sale and distribution of the new products. These products can be sold
          to manufacturers, retailers, or consumers, depending on the type of
          product and the market demand.

        <h2>The Solution To Waste</h2>
        <p>
          Plastic pollution is a major environmental issue that requires a
          comprehensive solution. The problem of plastic pollution has been
          increasing over the years as plastic has become an integral part of
          our daily lives. The production of plastic has increased tremendously,
          leading to a massive amount of plastic waste that ends up in
          landfills, rivers, and oceans. This waste poses a significant threat
          to marine life, birds, and other animals that can become entangled in
          plastic or mistake it for food.

              and utensils that are used only once before being discarded.
              Governments and businesses around the world have started
              implementing regulations to reduce the use of these items, such as
              banning single-use plastics or implementing fees for their use.
              Consumers can also play a role by choosing to use reusable
              alternatives like cloth bags and metal straws.

              Another solution to plastic pollution is cleaning up existing
              plastic waste in the environment. There are various organizations
              and programs that focus on removing plastic waste from the ocean,
              beaches, and other areas where it accumulates. This can involve
              using boats and nets to collect plastic waste or organizing beach
              cleanups with volunteers. Education and awareness campaigns are
              also important solutions to plastic pollution. By educating people
              about the impact of plastic waste on the environment and providing
              information on how to reduce plastic use and properly dispose of
              plastic waste, individuals can make a difference in reducing
              plastic pollution. International cooperation is also necessary to
              solve the problem of plastic pollution. Governments and
              organizations around the world need to work together to develop
              and implement effective solutions to plastic pollution. This can
              involve sharing best practices, investing in research and
              development, and promoting policies and regulations to reduce
              plastic waste. Finally, individual actions can also make a
              difference in reducing plastic pollution. By reducing our own use
              of plastic, properly disposing of plastic waste, and supporting
              businesses that prioritize sustainability and reducing plastic
              waste, we can all contribute to the solution to plastic pollution.
